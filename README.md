Assignment: Interactive Text Analyzer

This Python text analyzer asks the user to input a sentence and then shows a menu of operations where you can choose what to do with your sentence. This was made in VS Code with different extensions to assist in coding, debugging, and formatting. The program provides multiple text processing features such as reversing the sentence, counting vowels, checking if the sentence is a palindrome, finding and replacing words, converting text into title case, splitting it into words, generating word frequency counts, and swapping character cases.

I was confused at first on what to do and how to make a start, but once I did start writing the code, it just came naturally. The interface of VScode was not that hard to adapt compared to eclipse, and I also had fun experimenting with different extensions to make my coding a little bit fun.
